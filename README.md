# Twitter-Bot-Sentiment-Analysis
A twitter bot used to scrape tweets to analyze with sentiment analysis for the PROS Hackathon 2019. The bot works by using the Twitter API to pull tweets from popular laptop brands. Then, the bot uses TextBlob's Natural Language Processing to classify tweeets based on sentiment and polarity. The bot then exports the results into a consise CSV file and feds this data into our team's price forecasting model used to predict the prices of laptops based on historical data and real-time public sentiment.
