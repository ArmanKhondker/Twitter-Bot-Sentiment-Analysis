# Twitter-Bot-Sentiment-Analysis
A twitter bot used to scrape tweets to analyze with sentiment analysis for the PROS Hackathon 2019. The bot works by using the Twitter API to pull tweets from popular laptop brands. Then, the bot uses TextBlob's Natural Language Processing to classify tweeets based on sentiment and polarity. I then fed this data into our price forecasting model used to predict the prices of laptops based on historical data and real-time public sentiment.
